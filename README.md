My opinionated [Omarchy 2.0](https://omarchy.org/) setup.

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!** 

**The Flutter/Android Studio setup is currently broken due to [this issue](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/1300)!**

## Disclaimer

**This setup:**

**- Modifies configuration files!** (only `~/.bashrc` and `hyprland.conf` are backed up)

**- Installs and uninstalls packages!**

**- Has no uninstall!**

**- Comes as-is, without support/warranty/guarantee/whatsoever!**

**Use at your own risk!**

**I'm not responsible for anything!**

## Usage

```bash
make setup
```

## To do

- Finish Flutter/Android Studio/Android SDK setup.
- Add a screenshot here.
