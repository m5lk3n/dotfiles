# dotfiles

This repo contains my current dotfiles.

Personally, I use yet another Fedora 37 Workstation installation and macOS Ventura, both preferably with `zsh`. In addition to that, I use `bash` in different (cloud) environments for my work.

The only common denominator is `vim`. Needless to say, the latter has to be installed to make use of the dotfiles.

## Installation

To copy the dotfiles, run the following:

```bash
./make # run to show what happens when installing
./make install
```

Run `vim` and `:PlugInstall`. See [.vimrc](.vimrc) comments for more.
